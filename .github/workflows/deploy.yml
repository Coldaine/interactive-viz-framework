# NOTE: This workflow is OPTIONAL
#
# Vercel's GitHub integration is the recommended deployment method:
# 1. Connect your repository to Vercel via https://vercel.com/new
# 2. Vercel will automatically deploy on every push to main
# 3. Preview deployments are created for every PR
#
# To use this workflow instead:
# 1. Get your Vercel token: https://vercel.com/account/tokens
# 2. Add these secrets to your GitHub repository:
#    - VERCEL_TOKEN (from step 1)
#    - VERCEL_ORG_ID (found in Vercel team settings)
#    - VERCEL_PROJECT_ID (found in project settings)
# 3. Enable this workflow by committing it to your repository
